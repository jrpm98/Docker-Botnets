1.1.0	2013-11-18
FEATURE Updated probe and output module interface that allows arbitrary
	data to be passed from the probe module (e.g. additional TCP fields)
	that can then be output as requested.

FEATURE	Replaced simple_file, and redis_file output modules with csv module
	that allows user controlled output of what fields shoudl be output
	to a csv file. As well, implemented --list-output-fields that allows
	users to find what fields are available.	

FEATURE	Added output-filters that allow users to control what types of packets
	that want output (e.g. classification = "SYNACK" && is_repeat = 0)

FEATURE	Drop root privileges after opening necessary sockets if run as
	privileged user.

FEATURE	Added paged bitmap for removing duplicate responses so that if small
	subnets are scanned, large amount of memory is no longer required.

FEATURE	Fast scanning of small subnets. Scanning small subnets no longer
	requires iterating over the entire IPv4 address space, which allows
	ZMap-like speed for all network sizes.

FEATURE Scan CIDR blocks from the command-line instead of only through
	whitelist file (e.g. zmap -p 443 192.168.0.0/16 10.0.0.0/8)

FEATURE Redis output module now allows connecting to arbitrary redis servers
	and lists from the command-line via output module parameter

FEATURE JSON output module added

FEATURE 32-bit support

FEATURE UDP Packet Support

BUGFIX	Source port in UDP module corrected to use network order instead of
	host order

1.1.1	2013-12-16
BUGFIX	Fixed bit-map, which was incorrectly deduplicating responses

BUGFIX	CMake correctly installs files into /etc/zmap

1.1.2	2014-01-21
BUGFIX	Off-by-one error in paged bitmap


1.2.0	2014-03-10
FEATURE added MongoDB as a supported output module

BUGFIX	ICMP values added incorrectly, timestamp unavailable

BUGFIX	setting fixed number of probes may inadverantly target specific networks

BUGFIX	scans occasionally skip cooldown period due to lock issue

FEATURE	added context to allow easier packaging in Debian and Ubuntu and Fedora and Brew and Macports

FEATURE	remove dnet dependency for linux

FEATURE remove random extra printed saddr

FEATURE	build with optimizations by default

FEATURE	added JSON metadata output

FEATURE added syslog support

FEATURE	added BSD/mac support

BUGFIX	removed bizarre executible bits on random example code in git repo

FEATURE	added support for scanning by FQDN

FEATURE	adding sharding support

1.2.1	2014-06-09
FEATURE	autodetect number of sender threads

FEATURE add ignore-invalid-hosts option for blacklist

BUGFIX	UDP scans sometimes double-counted IP header length

BUGFIX	Properly check UDP packet length

BUGFIX	Integer overflow in json metadata when printing generator

BUGFIX	All calls to malloc checked for failure

2.1.0	2014-06-07

BUGFIX  ZMap now filters out packets that are from the local MAC instead of
        only capturing packets from the local gateway. The prior approach
        caused valid responses to be dropped for a fair number of users.

BUGFIX  ZMap would somtimes segfault if the number of threads was greater
        than the number of destination hosts.

BUGFIX  ZMap did not crash when it was unable to write to the output file
        This would cause ZMap to continue running when it was piped into another
        application and that application died. We not log_fatal if the output is
        no longer accessible per ferror.

CHANGED json output uses underscores instead of hyphens

CHANGED removes support for deprecated simple_file and extended_file options

BUGFIX  pcap filter captures outgoing packets

BUGFIX  install overwrites blacklist file

BUGFIX  output is sometimes colored

FEATURE	zblacklist (a standalone utility that allows you to efficiently check
        IP addresses against a zmap compatible whitelist and blacklist. This is
        helpful if you are doing something like cat list-of-ips | zgrab and to
        make sure that you're still following your blacklist.

FEATURE	ztee (a standalone utility that buffers between ZMap and ZGrab) and allows
        extracting just IP address from a larger ZMap output in order to complete
        follow up handshakes without losing any data.

CHANGED	remove space in csv output header

CHANGED	build with JSON support by default

FEATURE	ntp probe module

BUGFIX	finding a generator would crash with low probability

CHANGED	don't print blacklisted CIDR blocks to log. These are available in 
        --metadata-file and end up flooding the log with a ton of metadata.

FEATURE	status-updates-file (monitor output as a csv)

CHANGED	output to stdout by default

BUGFIX	use correct email for Zakir in AUTHORS

FEATURE	add redis-csv output module

CHANGED rename redis module to redis-packed

CHANGED	probe module API takes user data argument

FEATURE	colored log output

FEATURE	add pf_ring and 10GigE support

BUGFIX random-number generator is now thread safe

FEATURE	optional app-success field output in monitor

CHANGED remove type field from json output module and get rid of header

FEATURE Add icmp-echo-time probe module for measuring RTT

CHANGED remove --summary. This has been replaced by --metadata-file.

CHANGED JSON metadata now uses ISO-8601 compatible timestamps instead of proprietary log format.

CHANGED remove buggy and never officially-released DNS probe module

FEATURE MongoDB output module
